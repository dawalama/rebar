**Rebar** makes your Django Forms stronger.

Rebar is a collection of tools that make it easier to work with Django
forms and develop more complex abstractions. Rebar includes:

* Form Groups

  Treat a heterogeneous set of Forms or FormSets as a single logical
  Form.

* State Validators

  Validate that a Form is in a particular state. For some applications
  you want to allow users to save their work, even if they haven't
  completed the task. *State Validators* allow you to abstract the
  validation for specific states.

* Testing Tools

  Easily generate dictionaries of form data from a Form, FormSet, and
  FormGroup instances for use in unit tests.
